My second Task of my CodeAlpha Data Science Intern. âœ¨
Stock Prediction of any company I want and predicts its price by using LSTM.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is an interesting task.
Starting from the Data Collection : I gathered stock market data from Yahoo Finance. This data is served as my training dataset. By using the python library "!pip install yfinance".

In a supervised learning scenario like this, we need both input features (in this case, the train_data) and corresponding target labels (the data we want to predict). For stock price prediction, the target labels are typically the future closing prices.
